## The goal<br>
The main research goal is to set a program that will predict the gender of the author of a tweet and we could extend the model to any text.
To do it, we will use some text analytic and do classification.

## The Dataset<br>

We found our dataset on Kaggle, it contains around 25000 labeled tweets. It has many different columns, in the first time, we will concentrate our project on the tweet and on the gender.
