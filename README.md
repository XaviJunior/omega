The goal
The main research goal is to set a program for the constructors’ managers and engineers which can predict the maximum accrued Pitstop time that a team can afford depending on the:
• Race time
• Weather
• Driver
• Track
So, thank to this program the managers can know what is the eligible maximum accrued Pitstop to win the race or to finish in the targeted race time.
